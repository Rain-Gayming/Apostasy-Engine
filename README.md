# Apostasy Engine

---

## What is Apostasy?

Apostasy is a (relatively) simple in data driven game engine that is written in Rust. It will be open source for now and for ever.

---

## Warnings and usage:

Apostasy is incredibly early into development, at current it is not even in an early alpha stage, it has very rudimentary features. 
At current these include:
- A simple ECS,
- Windowing,
- VERY simple rendering

The ideals for an V0.1a release would be:
- A better ECS,
- UI,
- Lighting,
- Asset loading

---

## Versions:

Currently I would consider the engine in a V0.0.1a due to how early into the project it is.
For writing versions it follows this format Vx.y.zw
- x: major version
- y: minor version 
- z: sub version
- w: alpha (a), beta (b), test (t)
