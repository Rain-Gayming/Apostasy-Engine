vkQueueSubmit(): pSubmits[0].pSignalSemaphores[0] (VkSemaphore 0x5a000000005a) is being signaled by VkQueue 0x5560ee0fc610, but it may still be in use by VkSwapchainKHR 0x340000000034.
Most recently acquired image indices: [0], 1.
(Brackets mark the last use of VkSemaphore 0x5a000000005a in a presentation operation.)
Swapchain image 0 was presented but was not re-acquired, so VkSemaphore 0x5a000000005a may still be in use and cannot be safely reused with image index 1.
Vulkan insight: See https://docs.vulkan.org/guide/latest/swapchain_semaphore_reuse.html for details on swapchain semaphore reuse. Examples of possible approaches:
   a) Use a separate semaphore per swapchain image. Index these semaphores using the index of the acquired image.
   b) Consider the VK_KHR_swapchain_maintenance1 extension. It allows using a VkFence with the presentation operation.
The Vulkan spec states: Each binary semaphore element of the pSignalSemaphores member of any element of pSubmits must be unsignaled when the semaphore signal operation it defines is executed on the device (https://docs.vulkan.org/spec/latest/chapters/cmdbuffers.html#VUID-vkQueueSubmit-pSignalSemaphores-00067)
