vkCreateSwapchainKHR(): pCreateInfo->presentMode (VK_PRESENT_MODE_FIFO_RELAXED_KHR) is not supported (the following are supported ).
The Vulkan spec states: presentMode must be one of the VkPresentModeKHR values returned by vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfacePresentModesKHR for the surface (https://docs.vulkan.org/spec/latest/chapters/VK_KHR_surface/wsi.html#VUID-VkSwapchainCreateInfoKHR-presentMode-01281)

vkQueueSubmit(): pSubmits[0].pSignalSemaphores[0] (VkSemaphore 0x950000000095) is being signaled by VkQueue 0x5632b6d191e0, but it may still be in use by VkSwapchainKHR 0x760000000076.
Here are the most recently acquired image indices: [0], 1.
(brackets mark the last use of VkSemaphore 0x950000000095 in a presentation operation)
Swapchain image 0 was presented but was not re-acquired, so VkSemaphore 0x950000000095 may still be in use and cannot be safely reused with image index 1.
Vulkan insight: One solution is to assign each image its own semaphore. Here are some common methods to ensure that a semaphore passed to vkQueuePresentKHR is not in use and can be safely reused:
	a) Use a separate semaphore per swapchain image. Index these semaphores using the index of the acquired image.
	b) Consider the VK_KHR_swapchain_maintenance1 extension. It allows using a VkFence with the presentation operation.
The Vulkan spec states: Each binary semaphore element of the pSignalSemaphores member of any element of pSubmits must be unsignaled when the semaphore signal operation it defines is executed on the device (https://docs.vulkan.org/spec/latest/chapters/cmdbuffers.html#VUID-vkQueueSubmit-pSignalSemaphores-00067)
